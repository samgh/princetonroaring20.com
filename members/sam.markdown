### Bio

![Sam](/images/members/current/sam.jpg)

Although born to a family of two molecular biologists (don't ask him
to be any more specific) in Boston, MA, Sam has lived almost his
entire life in Princeton. He has been in musical groups since third
grade including three different choirs, 7 jazz and concert bands, and
1 a cappella group, and also plays piano and guitar which he thinks is
completely insane. In addition to making music with his father and
younger sister, Sam enjoys skiing, computer programming, and anything
of or pertaining to Frisbees. Also, Sam cannot remember anyone's name
to save his life, so when he asks you for the 7th time what your name
is, don't take it personally.
