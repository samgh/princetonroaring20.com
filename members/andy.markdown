### Bio

![Andy](/images/members/current/andy.jpg)

An Oregon boy emerging with hip rotations of sweaters that he collected from the most interesting homeless people on the streets of Portland, Andy Hunt is thrilled to have joined the R20 family. His sassy, perpetual rosy cheeks are the sources of his dynamic Bass vocal and are also a mood-indicator of his soul. He encountered real "dishes," or cuisines for the first time when he came to Princeton, as he grew up eating cereal (his favorite "food") and everything from Costco. Whenever he gets lonely, Andy reminisces over the day of his first kiss, which was on the cross country bus with a girl named Nicole. Currently, you can find Andy behind the bars of Wilson and if you're lucky, he might let you touch one of his sweaters for a few minutes.
