### Bio

![Deirdre](/images/members/current/deirdre.jpg)

From the larynx of the United Kingdom, Deirdre Merle Ely is a soprano as strong as her favorite tea (builder’s brew). She says her middle name “Merle” isn’t derived from “Merlin,” but her singing is certainly magic. Deirdre spent summer 2013 sailing across the Atlantic Ocean to come to Princeton. She says about the move, “the US is a quidditch field full of golden snitches and I’m Harry Potter.” Yes. Yes she is. Deirdre regularly consumes steak and chocolate but not together unless there’s money involved. She will study something like Politics or Woodrow Wilson School major with certificates in American Studies, Art History, and Ethics and Public Values, but isn’t sure if any of that is relevant or accurate.
