### Bio

![John](/images/members/current/john.jpg)

Despite spending the first 10 years of his life in upstate New York,
John is a southern boy at heart. Nothing will make him happier than an
afternoon of biscuits, sweet tea, the Avett Brothers, family, and good
friends. Despite this, he has a declared love for thrift stores,
vegetarian food, and foreign travel. This country/indie twist shows
his most prominent trait: indecisiveness. Now what to write about
next...
