### Bio

![Keelan](/images/members/current/keelan.jpg)

Keelan desperately wants to know why Mirrors by Justin Timberlake isn't still playing on the radio because for an entire summer he made friends exclusively by snapchat-belting that song every time it came on. He holds firm to a number of beliefs: there is never a situation where making a ridiculous face doesn't improve things dramatically, second verses are ALWAYS better, and no matter how tall you are...you're not that tall. Almost a year removed from the event, he still brags about that one time he yelled so loud for so long that he convinced his roommate the fire alarm was going off from a different part of the building. Lastly, he doesn't know whether to be proud or very concerned that not one piece of information on this page is made up.
