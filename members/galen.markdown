### Bio

![Galen](/images/members/current/galen.jpg)

Hailing from Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, you can hear Galen Mayhew filling out R20's bass section. Your best friend during any kind of apocalypse, Galen's hobbies include building a root cellar in his backyard and carving longbows in his spare time. Trying to use his years at Princeton the best he can, Galen hopes to write a novel and learn as much as he can about the Middle Ages. If you're looking for an interesting conversation, he's the guy to talk to!
