### Bio

![Izzy](/images/members/current/izzy.jpg)

The newest addition to the Sops, Izzy is a cheerful and entertaining girl from Connecticut. Raised on a small farm, she received ninja training at a young age and became a certified master at the age of 8. Each day Izzy orders around eight much larger men as a coxswain for the Princeton crew team. She is a top-notch student and athlete in addition to being musically-talented and is definitely THE friend to have.

CAUTION: If you are a slow walker, beware of O'Connell.
