### Bio

![Ben](/images/members/current/ben.jpg)

Ben is the newest male member of Roaring 20, and he enjoys singing loud and high, usually at the same time. Dispute the fact that he intended to be a science major, he spent a majority of his class time in high school in music related activities, including two choirs and two orchestras. When Ben is not singing, he enjoys drinking hot beverages, sleeping, building robots and napping.
