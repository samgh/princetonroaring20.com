### Bio

![Chanyoung](/images/members/current/chanyoung.jpg)

Hailing from the far-off land of Forbes, Chanyoung is a freshman bringing some sweet sizzle to the altos. Even though she’s originally from South Korea, she spent the last six years at the Peddie School in Hightstown, NJ, a 24 minute drive away, making her, in fact, a Princeton local! Chanyoung, however, loves her home country of Korea and in fact has relatives on both the North and South sides of the border. She is even one of the lucky few who have been into North Korea, where she went for a 3-day school trip in 7th grade during one of the few period of time in the last 60 years when it was allowed by the North Korean government. She described it as “beautiful."

When she's not at Roaring 20 Rehearsals Chanyoung can be found watching the sun set over the graduate college from the Forbes dining hall, cutting her hair in new and stylish ways, or using her powers to have a positive and inspiring effect on the lives of others.
