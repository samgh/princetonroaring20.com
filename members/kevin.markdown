### Bio

![Kevin](/images/members/current/kevin.jpg)

Kevin McElwee (MAC-el-wee) is a New Jersey native who calls the Jersey Shore “home”. He is a Physics major who spent the summer before freshman year working at his parents' golf range. Currently experimenting with facial hair, Kevin has been meticulously grooming a goatee since just before arriving at Princeton. In his free time, he follows two TV shows: ABC’s Modern Family and a drama about the Manhattan Project. Kevin loves to sing; he is a tender tenor enjoying private lessons, singing in Glee Club, and, of course, being a part of the R20 family. A perfect fit indeed!
