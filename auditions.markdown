### Audition Process

The Roaring 20 audition is quite painless and only takes about 15
minutes.

We begin the audition by introducing you to the group and getting to
know a little bit about you - where you're from, where you live, etc.

Then our Music Director, [Ben](/members/ben), will guide you
through some 5-tone scales to warm you up and test your range (though
we definitely recommend warming up a bit on your own before the
audition).

The next component of the audition is swells. Swells will help us get
an idea of your volume and control. First, Torin will play the pitch
we want to hear you swell on. Then you will start by singing as soft
as you possibly can, gradually crescendo to your loudest possible
volume, and decrescendo back to where you started. It doesn't matter
how long you hold the note for - we're mostly just interested in
hearing dynamic contrast.

Next comes pitch matching. Ben will play a few sets of 3 or 4 notes
on the piano and have you sing them back to the group. Try to sing
them as accurately as you can - if you need to hear the notes played
multiple times, that's completely fine.

Now we get to the fun part: the solo. You can perform for us any solo
from any genre of music. We recommend choosing a song that you're
comfortable with and that demonstrates your vocal strengths. Just to
give you some ideas, solos used by current members include: Someone to
Watch Over Me, I Just Can't Wait to be King, Heartless, Somewhere Over
the Rainbow, Walking in Memphis, and more.

In the final portion of the audition, the group will join you for a
blending exercise. Singers on your voice part will surround you, and
we will sing through a short phrase in 4-part harmony. You will have a
copy of the music to look at it if it helps you, but we are not
testing your sight-reading abilities. After hearing it as many times
as you need, you will join in on your part to give us an idea of how
your voice fits in with the rest of the group.

And then you're done! A member of Roaring 20 will come by your room
later that night to let you know if we have decided to call you back.
